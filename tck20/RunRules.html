<P>In order to demonstrate compliance with the Java Data Objects
specification, an implementation must successfully run all of the TCK
tests that are not on the “excluded” list. The implementation is
hereinafter referred to as the IUT (Implementation Under Test).</P>
<P>The results must be posted on a publicly accessible web site for
examination by the public. The posting includes the output of the
test run, which consists of multiple log files containing
configuration information and test results. For an example of the
required posting, please see <A HREF="http://db.apache.org/jdo/tck/final">http://db.apache.org/jdo/tck/final</A>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Prerequisites</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>In order to run the TCK, you must install maven 1.0.1 or 1.0.2.

driver of the test programs. Note that Maven 2 is not supported.</P>
<P>You must test the IUT on all configurations that the IUT supports.
This includes different hardware and operating systems, different
versions of Java, and different datastores. The TCK supports Java
versions from JDK 1.3 to 1.5.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Modifying
the Configuration</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The Implementation Under Test (IUT) can be installed into the
iut_jars directory in the TCK directory. Any .jar files in this
directory are added to the class path used to run the tests.</P>
<P>There are properties in the build.properties file in the TCK
directory that must be changed to configure the IUT execution and
enhancement (optional) environment. These properties begin with
iut.runtck and iut.enhancer. 
</P>
<P>There is one properties files that must be modified to be
IUT-specific. The iut-pmf.properties file in the TCK src/conf
directory contains information used to construct the
PersistenceManagerFactory used in the tests.</P>
<P>SQL DDL files are provided for the sql table definitions. The
existing files must not be changed, but files may be added in the
directory in order to provide DDL for additional databases supported
by the JDO implementation under test.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Running
the Tests</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>From the installation directory, change to the TCK directory. From
the TCK directory, call “maven build” which will build the jar
files used in the tests, create the Derby database, install the
schema into the Derby database, and run the TCK on the Reference
Implementation. Success indicates that the TCK was installed
correctly.</P>
<P>Then call “maven runtck.iut” to run the tests on the
Implementation Under Test. This will produce console output plus a
directory in the TCK/target/logs directory whose name contains the
date/time the tests were started. This directory contains the output
of the tests. This is the directory to be published.</P>
<P>Some of the TCK tests require the implementation to support up to
20 instances of PersistenceManager with open transactions
simultaneously.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Debugging
the IUT while running TCK tests</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Execute “maven help” in the TCK directory in order to get
information on running the TCK tests with a debugger. In particular,
properties jdo.tck.cleanupaftertest, jdo.tck.cfglist,
jdo.tck.identitytypes, and jdo.tck.dblist may be useful.</P>
<P>If you make a change to the IUT enhancer while debugging the TCK
tests (for implementations that use an enhancer) you must remove the
target/classes directory before continuing in order to make sure that
the classes are re-enhanced by the changed code.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Publishing
the Results of the TCK Tests</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>With a successful test run, the log directory with the results of
the tests must be published on a publicly-available web site. The
unmodified directory is the self-certification of the successful TCK
test run.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>First
Level TCK Appeals Process</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid">If any test
does not pass on the JDO implementation under test, this may be due
to an error in the implementation or in the TCK test. If you believe
that the failure is due to an error in the TCK test, you may
challenge the test. To do so, send email to: <A HREF="mailto:jdo-dev@db.apache.org">jdo-dev@db.apache.org</A>
with a subject line containing “CHALLENGE” and the name of the
test program, e.g.
org.apache.jdo.tck.api.persistencemanager.ThreadSafe.java; and the
body of the email containing the details of the challenge.</P>
<P>The Maintenance Lead will respond within 15 working days with a
decision on whether there is an error in the test case. If the issue
is found by the Maintenance Lead to be due to an error in the test
case, the Maintenance Lead might provide a patch that will be
included in the next maintenance revision. If the patch is not
provided within 15 working days of the receipt of the challenge, then
the test may be put into the TCK directory src/conf/exclude.list and
it will not be run as part of the TCK.</P>
<P>Decisions of the Maintenance Lead may be appealed to the full
expert group. A vote of the full expert group will be conducted by
the Maintenance Lead, and a majority of votes cast will decide the
issue. The Maintenance Lead has one vote, as does each member of the
expert group at the time of the vote.</P>
