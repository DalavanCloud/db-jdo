EXC_CannotGetJDOImplHelper=A SecurityException was thrown when trying to get \
the singleton JDOImplHelper instance. In order to get runtime metadata, you \

containing the JDO Reference Implementation (jdo.jar and jdori.jar).

EXC_CannotGetRuntimeJavaModelFactory=A SecurityException was thrown when trying \
to get the singleton RuntimeJavaModelFactory instance. In order to get runtime \
metadata, you must grant javax.jdo.spi.JDOPermission("getMetadata") to the \
